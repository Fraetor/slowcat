# Slowcat

A very slow concatenation program.

Much like the well known [cat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat_(Unix))
command, slowcat reads a file to standard output. The difference is that slowcat
does it slowly, one byte at a time. This can be used to emulate historic data
rates, or otherwise look generally nifty.

## Requirements and Installation

The only requirement of slowcat is [Python 3](https://www.python.org).

It can be installed on Linux simply by copying an executable `slowcat.py` into
`~/.local/bin/`. You may want to remove the file extension in this case.

## Usage

```text
usage: slowcat [-h] [-r RATE] [--version] [FILE ...]

Read out a file one byte at a time.

positional arguments:
  FILE                  the file(s) to read; use - or omit for standard input

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -r RATE, --rate RATE  how many bytes to read per second (default: 10)
  --version             show version information and exit
```
